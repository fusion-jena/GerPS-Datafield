# GerPS-Datafield

## abstract
The GerPS-Datafield is an extension for the [GerPs-Onto](https://w3id.org/GerPS-onto/ontology#). Besides the Procceses there are also forms, that contains the data that will be proccesed in Public Service. For this purpose there is the [XDatenfeld-Standard](https://www.xrepository.de/details/urn:xoev-de:fim:standard:xdatenfelder_2.0#version) as an [XÃ¶V](https://www.xoev.de/xoev-4987)-Standard. Its basicly an XML-protocoll for trasmitting data about these forms, but its not an semantic standard. So the GerPS-Datafield is the Semantic Version of this XDatenfeld-Standard. We integrated it in the GerPS-Onto to make this more interoperable and extend the possibilities to work with this semantic standards.
